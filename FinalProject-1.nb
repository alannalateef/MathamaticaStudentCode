to\\nsupport me in the past -- of which there were a few people -- I'm \
reaching\\nout to you for your guidance and your help so that we can work \
together and\\nunify our great country. Working together, we will begin the \
urgent task\\nof rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream. \
\\nHILLARY CLINTON, DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE: We have seen that our \
nation\\nis more deeply divided than we thought. But I still believe in \
America,\\nand I always will. And if you do, then we must accept this result \
and then\\nlook to the future. Donald Trump is going to be our president. We \
owe him\\nan open mind and the chance to lead. \\nBRET BAIER, ANCHOR: Donald \
Trump is the president-elect today. As we look at the map\\nof the states \
that were called, red obviously Republican, blue Democrat.\\nAnd you see some \
gray in there. That's because we have not called those\\nstates as of yet. \
Here is why -- Michigan, 96 percent of the vote is in,\\nand there you see it \
looks like Donald Trump is heading towards a win\\nthere. But again, we're \
waiting for some other vote to come in. But it\\nlooks like we're going to be \
able to eventually to call Michigan for Donald\\nTrump. In New Hampshire, 98 \
percent of the vote is in. It's not a big\\nstate. I don't know why it takes \
so long to get all these votes, but they\\nare still cooking. Senator Ayotte \
has conceded to Maggie Hassan, the\\nDemocrat, in that Senate race, but we \
have not called the presidential\\nrace. \\nIn Arizona, in red Arizona, 75 \
percent is in because you have a lot of\\nmail-in ballots that have to be \
counted. And there you see Donald Trump\\neventually will probably get \
another win there. \\nWith that, let's bring in our panel: Jonah Goldberg, \
senior editor of National Review; Mercedes Schlapp, columnist for The \
Washington Times; Mara Liasson, national political correspondent of National \
Public Radio, and syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer. Mara, your \
thoughts? \\nMARA LIASSON, NATIONAL PUBLIC RADIO: Well, it was an upset for \
the ages.\\nAs we have been saying all night long, it was incredible. \
Everybody was\\nwrong, including Donald Trump who didn't think he was going \
to win, but he\\ndid. And he really did bust apart the coalitions and the \
maps for both\\nparties. I think that the Republican party now is white \
working class\\nparty. It has got the rustbelt now as part of its base. And \
the Democrats\\nare kind of trying to deal with their shock and figuring out \
what went\\nwrong. In the circular firing squad department, I think they have \
a couple\\npeople to aim at. James Comey, I hear a lot about, Anthony Weiner,\
\\nWikiLeaks and Hillary Clinton herself who turned out to be a pretty \
weak\\ncandidate, a lot of baggage, and a status quo candidate in a \
change\\nelection. \\nBAIER: If you look at policies of the next president \
should be in the exit\\npolls, same as President Obama, 28 percent, more \
conservative, 48 percent,\\nmore liberal, 17 percent. Of those 17 percent, 22 \
percent of them voted\\nfor Donald Trump. So that, Mercedes, is the Bernie \
Sanders vote I would\\nassume. \\nMERCEDES SCHLAPP, THE WASHINGTON TIMES: \
That's right. \\nBAIER: And those are probably people who did not talk to the \
exit poll\\npeople because they said I'm not going to tell them that I'm \
voting for\\nDonald Trump. \\nSCHLAPP: And I also think it's a trade policy \
message they were trying to\\npush through because when you think about it, \
Bernie Sanders, first of all,\\nran against the status quo, secondly, talked \
about the problems with trade,\\nwith TPP, with NAFTA. That's the same \
message that we have seen Donald\\nTrump push forward in this election. \
\\nAnd I think it's one of the reasons why Donald Trump has just -- \
was\\nable to do so well in the rust belt states with the white working \
class,\\nwhere they have seen manufacturing jobs leave their communities, \
companies\\ngo away, and the opportunity for Donald Trump to really hone in \
on that\\neconomic trade message which at the same time worked with the \
Bernie\\nSanders supporters. \\nBAIER: Jonah. You have never been a fan. What \
did you think of the\\nspeech in what do you think of president-elect Donald \
Trump? \\nJONAH GOLDBERG, NATIONAL REVIEW: Look, I've been eating a\\nlot of \
crow, which tastes remarkably like black swan. This is a remarkable\\nthing \
that Donald Trump did. I thought his speech was actually very good\\nand very \
smart. And I think the never-Trump movement is by definition\\nover, because \
he won. We lost. You have to -- particularly if you are a\\nconservative, you \
have to give him a fresh start and give him the benefit\\nof the doubt. If \
Hillary Clinton can do it, I can do it. \\nAnd I thought he did a very good \
job of sending that signal. I think there\\nare a lot of pitfalls he could \
fall into with that. I do think -- and I\\ndon't want to take anything away \
from his victory which was really\\nimpressive. It is really important to \
pick up on something that Mara said.\\nThis was also Hillary Clinton's \
defeat. This was a really poor performance\\nby Hillary Clinton. Very low \
turnout from key constituencies. You had\\nless turnout overall than did you \
in 2004 for John Kerry. We have got\\nsomething like 40 million more people \
on the voter rolls. The Democratic\\nParty nominated literally the worst \
person they could for a change election\\nand they rallied around it. And she \
was a bad candidate both in theory and\\nin practice. \\nBAIER: And what do \
you think this means for President Obama's legacy?\\nWhat is this saying? Is \
it a repudiation of President Obama? \\nGOLDBERG: I think it is a direct \
outgrowth of it, and I think it's really\\nbad news for Barack Obama's \
legacy. Barack Obama condescended from a great\\nheight upon his political \
opponents for eight years. He had sort of an\\nOlympian disdain for anybody \
that disagreed with more, as his party became\\nmore leftwing, more \
dismissive of concerns of the working class, started\\ntalking opening about \
killing things like the coal industry. And it ticked\\noff a lot of people \
and rightly so. And Donald Trump tapped into that. \\nBAIER: You have also \
evolved since the beginning of our panel talk of this\\nelection. \\nCHARLES \
KRAUTHAMMER, SYNDICATED COLUMNIST: Yes. I have now reached sort\\nof a stage \
of -- I'm halfway there. There's no question that what Donald\\nTrump did was \
historic, amazing. And he deserves all the credit for it.\\nAs Paul Ryan \
said, he was the only one who heard the voice out there. And\\nthat was the \
fact that the Reagan Democrats, the old white working class\\nthat Reagan \
corralled, had gone away and nobody was listening to that. And\\nhe tuned in \
to that and that's how he won the election. \\nAnd I do think what's even \
more amazing is the fact that whereas everybody\\nwas worrying on the \
Republican side that he would damage the down ballot\\ncandidates, he \
actually had coattails and he helped to pull some of the\\ndown ballot \
candidates over the finish line. And I agree secondly that the\\nother person \
responsible for this Trump triumph is Hillary, probably the\\nworst candidate \
possibly one could imagine. \\nBut I think what's overlooked is the role that \
Barack Obama did. Remember\\nhe said two years ago, I'm not on the ballot, \
but my policies are, and he\\ngot shellacked. Then he said, this year my \
legacy is on the ballot. And I\\nthink he's going to lose it. I think it's \
going to be undone, much of it,\\nin the first 100 days starting with \
Obamacare. Everything that he signed,\\nall the executive orders are gone. \
And I think he ends up a historic\\nparentheses. He left the Democrats in \
ruins at every level. The\\ngovernorships, the state houses, the House and \
the Senate, and now the\\nWhite House. He has been a wrecking ball for \
Democrats, and I think he\\ndeserves a lot of the credit for Trump's victory. \
\\nBAIER: Talk about Secretary Clinton, a lot of people praising, Mara, \
the\\nspeech today where she emoted. Obviously she talked about bringing \
the\\ncountry together. Let's listen to her last speech like this and this \
one. \\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) \\nCLINTON: Although we weren't able to shatter \
that highest, hardest glass\\nceiling this time, thanks to you, it got about \
18 million cracks in it.\\nAnd the light is shining through like never \
before, filling us all with the\\nhope and the sure knowledge that the panel \
will be a little easier next\\ntime. \\n(APPLAUSE) \\nCLINTON: I know we have \
still not shattered that highest and hardest glass\\nceiling. But some day \
someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might\\nthink right now. \
\\n(APPLAUSE) \\n(END VIDEO CLIP) \\nBAIER: Just talking to people in this \
town, they are catatonic today. I\\nthink that's a fair word. Just \
anecdotally heard that shopping centers\\nwere quiet. Washington, D.C. is \
elite establishment. \\nLIASSON: It's a blue -- dark blue spot. \\nBAIER: As \
I said, this morning heads are exploding here that they can't\\nbelieve it. \
\\nLIASSON: I think they can't believe it for a number of reasons, not \
just\\nthat it was a partisan ideological contest, but also that for so \
many\\npeople, and I've heard this from Republicans who thought that Donald \
Trump\\nwas beyond the pale and that he wasn't -- his demeanor, his disregard \
for\\ndemocratic values and institutions, all of those things made \
him\\nunthinkable. And I think the shock of it was also part of the reason \
why\\nyou have got this reaction. The financial markets, the betting markets \
-- \\nBAIER: Although they finished -- \\nLIASSON: They bounced back. They \
predicted that she would win. They\\nbuilt that in. \\nBAIER: Finished the \
day at the highest. Final word on this. I want to go\\nto the break. \
\\nSCHLAPP: I have to say at the end this is a rejection of Obama's \
legacy,\\nof his imperial presidency. I think when you look at the lack \
of\\nenthusiasm, the fact that you saw these skyrocketing Obamacare premiums \
as\\nwell as the distress of Hillary Clinton, it all played a role in \
weakening\\nHillary Clinton. And it gave Trump that advantage.\>\"", "}"}]}]],\
